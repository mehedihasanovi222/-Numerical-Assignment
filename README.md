## Problem Statement

We need to solve the following initial value problem (IVP):

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -2y, \quad y(0) = 1
$$

* Implement **Euler’s Method** and **Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4)**.
* Compare numerical solutions with the **exact solution**:

  $$
  y(x) = e^{-2x}
  $$
* Analyze **accuracy** and **stability** of both methods.
